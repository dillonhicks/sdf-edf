This is an implentation of the **Earliest Deadline First** scheduling
algorithm as an SDF kernel module for the KUSP HGS framework.

Testing Instructions
********************

- Bootstrapping: Most of the times these steps can be skipped for
   normal ITTC development.

    - Checkout the KUSP Software, KUSP kernel, and KUSP kernel
       configurations, as stated at `http://www.ittc.ku.edu/kusp/new`

    - Install the KUSP Software::

        $ cd $KUSPROOT
	$ make
	$ make install REMOTE=<your-testbed>

- Build the proper kernel

   - You will need the hgs-smp.config from
      `configs/tphagan/hgs-smp.config`

   - If you followed the KUSP advice pages you will be able to
      accomplish this similarly to::

          $ cd $KUSPKERNELROOT
	  $ mkdir build
	  $ cp <configs-path>/configs/tphagan/hgs-smp.config .config/build/.config
	  $ make O=build oldconfig
	  $ cd build
	  $ make -j3 

      You may wish to adapt this snippet to handle multiple build
      configurations under your build directory. I do this based on
      the name of the config of whcih I am building::

          $ cd $KUSPKERNELROOT
	  $ mkdir -p builds/hgs-smp
	  $ cp <configs-path>/configs/tphagan/hgs-smp.config .config/builds/hgs-smp/.config
	  $ make O=builds/hgs-smp oldconfig
	  $ cd builds/hgs-smp
	  $ make -j3 
      
      This can be helpful depending on what you are working.

- Install the proper kernel::

       $ ssh <my-testbed>
       $ cd $KUSPKERNELROOT/build	
       $ sudo make modules_install
       $ sudo make install
       $ sudo reboot    

   After which you will need to wait for your testbed to reboot -- at
   times this can take a while, that is why I advocate use of KVMS.
	   
- Make and install the sdf_edf.ko kernel module::

       $ cd $KUSPROOT/workspace/sdf_edf/kmods/sdf_edf
       $ make
       ... output ...
       $ sudo make install

   To make sure that your installation was successful::

      $ lsmod | grep hgs_sdf_edf
      hgs_sdf_edf             4816  0 

   Yes, it was installed.

- Building a test::
   
      $ cd $KUSPROOT/workspace/sdf_edf/tests/<some-test>
      $ make 
      ...  lots of CMake/Make output ...
      
   Make sure to check for warnings and errors.::

      $ make run
      
   This will use *dskictrl** to execute the program as stated in the
   test's `.dski` configuration file.


- **[FUTURE] Postprocessing**


Notes and Forewarnings
**********************

- If you did not install the udev rules when installing the KUSP
  software, you should due to `/dev/ccsm` and `/dev/group_sched` will
  have the default permissions::

       $ ls -la /dev/{ccsm,group_sched}
       crw------- 1 root system 10, 63 2011-06-02 02:01 /dev/ccsm
       crw------- 1 root system 10, 62 2011-06-02 02:01 /dev/group_sched

  So you will not be able to open the CCSM and HGS IOCTL file
  descriptors. The naive and time wasting approach is to `chmod 666`
  them on startup; The best way is to install the UDEV rules::
  
      $ sudo cp $KUSPROOT/misc/40-kusp.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

- If there is an error during execution for some reason do note that
  your system may:

    - Explode (very likely)
    - Panic
    - Deadlock
    - Have residual hierarchies in HGS or sets in CCSM that need to be
      cleaned up.

  
  In all of these cases it is prudent to reboot the machine.
