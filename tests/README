Also see the requirements.rst for sdf_edf for more information.

The user space test programs are given designations that correspond to
their iteration/generation in requirements.rst (although I believe
requirements starts numbering at 1 and the programs start numbering at
0). Since they are for "Earliest Deadline First User Program
Iteration#" they are thus named (for brevity) in the form:

    edfup#

edfup0: Simple tunable cpu bound workloops example for 1, 2, 4, and 8
    cpus.

edfup1: Same as edfup0 but insert nanosleeps.

edfup2: Change dealine units to use timespec

edfup (no number) is a symlink to the most current edf user program.


Misc
****

future: Just random scenarious and code ideas that I may want to use
    for testing in the future.


Historical Reference
********************

cpu-bound-workloops: Inital code off of which edfup0 was based. Had to
    change the name of some of the C files due to some of the
    automagic naming from DUSI.

dsuidbg: Experimental directory where I was trying to figure out an
    arcane BUG in DSUI. Moral of the story, you always need at least
    one insturmentation point in your code if you are compiling
    against dsui.
