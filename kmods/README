======

Each of the directories under kmods represents a deveopmental stage of
the edf kernel module as outlined in requirements.rst.

The current iteration will be sdf_edf#/ where # is the highest number
of all of the directories under kmods and previous iterations will be
given the number corresponding to their iteration.

For example, sdf_edf0 would correspond to EDF Iteration 0.

And if kmods/ had the children:

sdf_edf0/
sdf_edf1/
sdf_edf2/
sdf_edf3/


So, sdf_edf3 would be the most current [and likely unstable/developmental] iteration.

Also, there is a symlink "sdf_edf" which should alway link to the most
current development iteration.
